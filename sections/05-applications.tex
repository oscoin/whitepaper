\section{Applications and future work}

\oscoin{} as a platform has the potential to enable novel applications for
software communities. In comparison to a general purpose computer like
Ethereum, \oscoin{} provides primitives focused towards code collaboration
(Section \ref{s:ledger}) and enables developers to combine them in flexible ways.

While it’s hard to describe all the possible ways \oscoin{} might be used, we
believe the following categories of applications can benefit from \oscoin{}’s
architecture.

\subsection{Governance and collective decision making}

In the first category, we believe that developers could leverage \oscoin{}’s
network graph ($\netgraph$) in order to make collective decision through smart
contracts.  Developers will have the ability to design smart contracts that
leverage the network graph in order to align interests between all network
participants of an open source project and incentivize further participation.
In addition, smart contracts can be used within these organizations in order to
coordinate around contentious decisions, using a diverse set of decision making
modules.

\subsection{Trust minimization for software development processes}
The second category of applications leverages the availability of contribution
histories on chain, in order to design new software development processes that
minimize trust between network participants.

Rather than relying on the weak trust model of existing centralized hosting
providers, \oscoin{} can be used to create powerful continuous integration
pipelines that use cryptography to ensure that every commit can be trusted.

This category of applications is particularly relevant to high-assurance
software such as cryptocurrencies and navigation systems.

\subsection{Incentivization}
The third category of applications we forsee is the one related with
developer incentives. This might include applications that (a) expose paid work
within the \oscoin{} network, (b) describe and enforce service level agreements
between projects and their dependencies, or (d) re-imagine crowd-funding
applications such as Patreon, taking advantage of digital money and collectibles.
