\section{Smart contracts}
\label{s:smart-contracts}

\newcommand{\handler}[1]{\textsc{\small#1}}

In order to ensure that funds distributed to projects by the \oscoin{} treasury
and those received as donations are spent responsibly and transparently, the
\oscoin{} protocol sends them to a special type of account: the \emph{project
fund}, which is administered by an updatable \emph{smart contract}.
In addition, the protocol requires that transfers from the project fund only be
issued from within the fund's smart contract. When a contributor decides to
contribute code to a project, they may inspect the contract currently in place,
and under what conditions it may be updated, to understand the project's
remuneration model, and whether or not they would be rewarded for their work.

\subsection{Definition}
A smart contract is a set of functions, or \emph{handlers}, invoked as part
of regular transaction processing. Certain transactions, such as $\mathsf{transfer}$
make use of smart contracts to extend their behavior and allow projects to
program and automate aspects of their finances, ownership model, or governance.

\subsection{Receiving \oscoin{}}

When a project receives \oscoin{}, the smart contract associated with that
project's fund is invoked. The specific handler called in the smart contract
depends on the \emph{sender}: for \oscoin{} received from the treasury system,
the \handler{receiveReward} handler is called, while for transfers received
from any other source, the \handler{receiveTransfer} handler is called. This
for instance, allows projects to handle funds received by the treasury differently
than funds received as donations.

\subsubsection{Rewards from the treasury}

The \handler{receiveReward} handler is invoked every $\epoch$ blocks for
projects getting a reward. The function is called with three arguments: $p$ is
a dictionary containing the project data, $r \in \posnat$ represents the amount
of \oscoin{} being awarded to the project this epoch and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is the
current epoch. The function must return a \emph{distribution}, a set of tuples
assigning an amount of \oscoin{} to a set of accounts. The function is valid
as long as it doesn't distribute more than $r$ \oscoin{} in total. Any \oscoin{}
that isn't distributed is effectively \emph{burnt}.

When a project is first registered, \handler{receiveReward} returns the empty
distribution, that is, the entirety of the reward $r$ is burned:
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{receiveReward}{$p, r, k$}
        \State \textbf{return} $\varnothing$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\noindent Once the project maintainers have decided on a policy, they may issue a
transaction to update this handler. For example, they may decide that all
contributors should get an equal share of future rewards, with the remainder
deposited into the project fund:

\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{receiveReward}{$p, r, k$}
        \State $n \gets |\prop{p}{contributors}|$
        \State $q \gets r \sslash n$
        \State $m \gets r \mod n$
        \State $x \gets \{ (\prop{c}{addr}, q) \mid c \gets \prop{p}{contributors} \}$
        \State \textbf{return} $x \cup \{ (\prop{p}{fund}, m) \}$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
This makes it very easy for a potential contributor to see whether or not they
would be rewarded for their contributions to a project, and in what proportion.

\subsubsection{Transfers and donations}

When a transfer of \oscoin{} is received from a source other than the treasury,
the \handler{receiveTransfer} handler is invoked. This function takes the same
three arguments as \handler{receiveReward}, plus a fourth argument $s$ which
represents the sender or ``source'' account of the transfer. The function is
expected to return a distribution, just like \handler{receiveReward}. Initially,
this handler is set to simply transfer the funds to the project fund:
\medskip
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{receiveTransfer}{$p, r, k, s$}
        \State \textbf{return} $\{ (\prop{p}{fund}, r) \}$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
Like the \handler{receiveReward} example, it is possible to include
arbitrary logic in this handler. For example, since donations to the project
would invoke this handler, a project might want to distribute a percentage
of each donation to its contributors, and the rest to its maintainers.

\subsection{Contract handler updates}

Updates to the project smart contracts are issued using the
\[
    \tx{updatecontract}{P_a, h, c, \nu, v}
\]
transaction, which must be signed by a project maintainer, where $h$ is the
\emph{handler} to be updated, $c$ is the code for the new handler, $v$ is a set
of \emph{votes}: a collection of signatures the maintainer has collected for the
update, and $\nu$ is a \emph{nonce} to prevent voting replay attacks.

Since updating a contract may affect existing contributors by, for example,
changing the share of rewards they receive for their work; the rules according
to which handlers may be updated are also stored in the project contract, as the
\handler{updateContract} handler. The conditions under which an
$\mathsf{updatecontract}$ transaction is considered valid are specified in this
handler.

\handler{updateContract} is a function which takes three arguments: $p$,
the project data, $h$, the name of the handler being updated, and $v$, the list
of public keys which signed votes for the contract update transaction. The
function must return a boolean value, stating whether the update is valid ($\top$)
or not ($\bot$). The default code for this handler is:
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{updateContract}{$p, h, v$}
        \State \textbf{return} $\{ \prop{o}{addr} \mid o \gets \prop{p}{maintainers} \} \subseteq v$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
which specifies that all the current maintainers must sign any contract update.

In order to specify that contract updates must be accepted by a majority of all
\emph{contributors}, this handler could be updated to:
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{updateContract}{$p, h, v$}
        \State $h \gets |\prop{p}{contributors}| \sslash 2$
        \State $v' \gets \{ \prop{c}{addr} \mid c \gets \prop{p}{contributors} \} \cap v$
        \State \textbf{return} $|v'| > 1 + h$
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
If the handler returns $\top$, the contract update transaction is considered
valid, and the handler $h$ specified in the transaction is updated with the new code
$c$.

\subsection{Ad-hoc spending}

While most distribution of \oscoin{} can be automated by the
\handler{receiveReward} and \handler{receiveTransfer} handlers, it will also be
necessary to occasionally transfer \oscoin{} manually from the project fund to
another account. For example, in a scenario where a project receives a large
donation, the maintainers may want to hold some funds in reserve for future
organizational expenditures.

Hence, it is possible to spend project funds with the $\mathsf{transfer}$
transaction and an additional set of parameters:
\[
    \tx{transfer}{P_a, a, n, \nu, v} \mid n \in \posnat,
\]
where $P_a$ is the project fund account to spend from, $a$ is the account to
transfer the funds to, $n$ is the amount of \oscoin{}, and the remaining two
parameters are a set of votes.

The transaction's validity is determined by the \handler{sendTransfer} handler,
which works in a similar way to \handler{updateContract}. For
example, the function might specify that the project maintainers may spend a small
amount $x$ of \oscoin{} per month without seeking community agreement, however
large sums may need over half of the contributors and donors to sign off:
\medskip
\begin{algorithmic}[0]
    \Procedure{sendTransfer}{$p, n, a, v$}
        \If{$\fn{spentThisEpoch}{p} + n > x$}
            \State $h \gets |\prop{p}{contributors} \cup \prop{p}{donors}| \sslash 2$
            \State $c' \gets \{ \prop{c}{addr} \mid c \gets \prop{p}{contributors} \}$
            \State $d' \gets \{ \prop{d}{addr} \mid d \gets \prop{p}{donors} \}$
            \State $v' \gets v \cap c' \cap d'$
            \State \textbf{return} $|v'| > 1 + h$
            \Else
            \State \textbf{return} $\top$
        \EndIf
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\section*{}

Leveraged the right way, smart contracts are a powerful tool the community has
to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide transparency and trust within projects, by making reward
        distribution explicit and automatic.
    \item Allow potential contributors to easily assess a project before contributing.
    \item Allow projects and their flow of \oscoin{} to be transfered over to a
        new maintainer with low risk.
    \item Offer a certain stability to existing members and collaborators, by
        making changes to contracts difficult without community buy-in.
\end{enumerate}
