\section{Background}

\begin{epigraph}{The Open-Source Everything Manifesto}
    \noindent It is in this light that we must recognize that only a restoration of
    open-source culture, and all that enables across the full spectrum of
    open-source possibilities, can allow humanity to harness the distributed
    intelligence of the collective and create the equivalent of heaven on Earth
    --- in other words, a world that works for all.

\subsection{Cryptocurrencies and money}

The invention of digital scarcity made it possible to economically incentivize
and remunerate network participants for their service in a simple and
transparent way, without mediation by a trusted third-party. The introduction
of Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin}, and later Ethereum~\cite{ethereum}, led to an
explosion of alternative cryptocurrencies that primarily compete on network
utility and monetary policy of the provisioned economy.

% TODO: I am finding the following paragraph a bit odd for an opening
% paragraph. Funding the development of oscoin software isn't the fundamental
% goal. I agree that this is a cute example (it brings in all the relevant
% actors and shows that an undeniably valuable OS project isn't being funded by
% any mechanism), but maybe we should move it to nearer the end of this section,
% e.g. to give evidence to 'spare time of a developer are becoming critical
% public infrastructure'.

If Bitcoin sought to reward network operators for their service in validating
transactions, other projects such as Zcash and Decred extended that reward to
incentivize value creators contributing to the protocol's development, in order to
further stimulate their economy. Despite most of these experiments, till today,
no cryptocurrency has succeeded in creating sustainable incentives for
developers who either contribute directly to the protocol, or indirectly to the
open source infrastructure that underlies it.

The problem is another iteration of the challenges associated with the
incentivization of free and open source software that have been broadly
discussed and studied in literature~\cite{roads and bridges}.

\subsection{Developer incentives and sustainability}
\label{s:incentives}

To further motivate this work, we must familiarize ourselves with the
conditions in which free and open source software is developed. Most of the
software we use on a daily basis relies on free and public code. In an
increasingly digitized society, these open source projects have become the
foundation of digital infrastructure underpinning many of our societal goods
and services.

With the emergence of software hosting sites like GitHub and community sites
like Stack Overflow, the open source paradigm became the focal point of
software engineering, resulting in the development of numerous high quality
projects which are openly available for anyone to use. This phenomenon helped
companies reduce lead times and bring products to the market faster as well as
recruit talent from a new pool of technologists, educated on the basis of
open source software.

Today, many open source projects are started by individuals or small groups of
people solving a personally, socially, or technologically relevant problem. By
analysing people's motivations for participating in the open source ecosystem,
the following themes emerge: pride in one's work, reputation, learning,
responsibility for something they believe in, being part of a community, and
financial compensation.

While most open source software projects start for the reasons above, the ones
that gain momentum require significant resources in time and money to maintain.
This creates a fundamental problem: these projects created in a developer's
spare time are becoming critical public infrastructure. While some developers
find ways to finance their efforts, most struggle to keep up with the requests
of the community during their free time, often abandoning their projects or
burning out under the increased burden of responsibility.  This is at the core
of the problem we address in this paper.
