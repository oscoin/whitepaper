\noindent In this paper, we introduce \oscoin{}, a protocol and currency
designed to provide a solution to the open source sustainability problem.

The \oscoin{} network is a public network of computers operating a distributed
consensus protocol around a transaction ledger.

% TODO: Move formalities and mathematical notation to after the 'overview';
% i.e. make this lighter.

This ledger is materialized into a shared state $\state$ which
contains the canonical registry $\mathcal{R}$ of all open source
projects participating in the \oscoin{} protocol; a set of accounts
$\mathcal{A}$, containing the balances of all currency holders; and
finally a network graph $\netgraph$, of relevant relations between
entities in the network, including in particular dependencies between
registered projects.
% TODO: Registry letter is wrong

The purpose of this network is to secure a digital currency---\oscoin{}---and
rewards the most valued open source projects in the network, without the need
for intermediaries or central control.

\subsection{Protocol Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintainers and contributors collaborate around software projects
        registered on the network.
    \item Maintainers specify what other projects their projects depend on.
    \item Every $n$ blocks, projects have their \osrank{} calculated, and a
        token reward is calculated for each, in proportion to their rank.
    \item The rewards are sent to the given projects.
    % TODO: We need to talk about smart-contracts somewhere else in the paper.
    \item Projects are able to use the funds how they see fit, through
        \emph{Smart contracts} which are used to distribute currency to its
        constituent members or contributors.
    % TODO: Revise this point ^
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Oscoin Blockchain}

% TODO: Is the notation introduced here used anywhere else? At the moment the
% 'transactions' section is rather loose. I think either we make the ledger
% section more formal in terms of $\state$, etc. or we drop the notation here.

The \oscoin{} network is composed of a set of nodes, or \emph{replicas}, which
execute a distributed protocol. Together, these nodes form a \emph{Replicated
  State Machine} with a set of states $\state$, a transition function $\epsilon$,
a starting state $\state_0$ or ``genesis'', a set of inputs $B_0, \ldots, B_n$,
and a set of outputs.

To allow for the creation of a safe, open (``permissionless'') currency shared
amongst all network participants, we use a blockchain protocol, as described by
Nakamoto in \cite{bitcoin} and Wood in \cite{ethereum}.

Though the specific choice of the underlying consensus mechanism is not
directly relevant to \oscoin{}, we believe that one which allows open
participation is best for the long term health of the network. Furthermore,
it's important that reliable support for light clients be possible. The only
family of blockchain protocols with these characteristics are the proof-of-work
protocols.

The inputs $B_0, \ldots, B_n$ to the state machine are therefore blocks, with
$B_0$ being the genesis block.

\subsection{The Oscoin Treasury}
% TODO: ^ Revisit this name from a brand perspective

Each block, the protocol is allowed to mint a certain amount $B_r$ of \oscoin{}
(the ``block reward''), as part of what we call the \emph{coinbase}
transaction. These coins are allocated to two distinct groups: network operators (``miners''), and open source projects, through the reward mechanism described in
this section.

\subsubsection{Token distribution}

The key question we must answer, is how the block reward is distributed to
projects and contributors within the network.

The goal is to choose a distribution function that rewards projects relative to
their importance within the network, while needing the least amount of
maintenance.

% TODO: ^ Re-word the above paragraphs
% TODO: We don't talk about value capture at all

For this, we turn to the network graph $\netgraph$, which includes in
dependencies between projects as well as contributions.

Each project registered in the network is required to specify which other
projects it depends on. For example, a web framework might depend on an HTTP
library, and that HTTP library might depend on an OpenSSL implementation.

% TODO: 'epoch' is undefined at this point.
\subsubsection{Algorithm} Let $T$ be the amount of \oscoin{} to be distributed
to $N$ projects every epoch. The amount $T_P$ distributed to a given project $P$
is in proportion to its \osrank{}. \osrank{}, described in \S \ref{s:osrank} is
a centrality measure that assigns a weight $\omega(P)$ to each project by
following links in the network graph $\netgraph$.

The amount of tokens received every epoch by $P$ is governed by the
\emph{payment function} $\psi(T, \omega(P))$. The payment
function takes into account a minimum threshold, under which the project
doesn't receive anything. This threshold prevents small attacks from
succeeding, while also concentrating the rewards.

With this model, itâ€™s the responsibility of a project to choose its
dependencies well and to maintain its stated dependencies up to date, since by
depending on a project, it is casting a vote for that project to receive money.
This is amplified for highly-weighted projects in the graph.

At scale, this mechanism has the potential to solve many of the issues with
open source monetization and sustainability, as software projects receive
income in the form of \oscoin{} by giving away their work for free.
